            I was born in Madrid, Spain. When I was 1, my family and I moved to Miami for 3 years. Went back to Madrid,
            Practiced diferent sports like tennis, golf, soccer and ski. Lived there until I was 16, that was
            when I came to the United States as an exchange student. I was sent to Philipsburg, Pennsylvania where
            I had an amazing year. Now I live in Connecticut with my parents and three siblings currently enrolled
            in Uconn Stamford for Digital Media & Design.

        <h3>Atletico de Madrid</h3>

        <p>The story of almost any ever known Disney movie. The story of a
          small, defenseless character, which always had a lot to offer but had
          bad luck throughout life. The Treasure Planet, El Dorado, Toy Story, Finding Nemo... Atletico
          de Madrid. A team which in the year 1996 won a double, and three years later got relegated to
          the second division, along with many institutional problems. Couldn't come back to the first division
          after the first year, but that was when Fernando "El Nino" Torres  came into play, being only 18
          years old. With him and the help of a team that had lost it's soul, and wasn't sure where it was
          going, we came back to the first division.
<img src="atleti.png" alt="Atletico" width="200" align="left"/>
          Years went by, Atletico was becoming a pretty solid mid-table team but had a problem: One day we would
          beat Barcelona 4-3 (On a season which they only lost one game, this one) and the next, we would get
          kicked out of the Copa del Rey against a Segunda B team. You never knew what was going to happen.
          More years went by, great players came and went, but something was cooking.
          In between those dark years we happen upon a UEFA Europa League title. Very important win in a
          Final against Fulham, the Diego Forlan days... And with that, a Europe Supercup title.
          But then a decision that would change the club's history was made. It was around Christmas of 2011, Atletico
          had been kicked out of Copa del Rey by a second divission team, and were 4 points from relegation in
          the league. Still alive in the Europa League. And that's when it happened. Diego Pablo Simeone,
          new Atletico de Madrid manager.
          I could go on and on about how he changed everything in the club and we became a real competitive
          team. I'll try not to.
          I'll start with a number that sums up Simeone's work in the club: We hadn't beat Real Madrid
          once in the last 14 years. Since he came, we've won 6 out of 13 League and Copa del Rey matches.
          Add to that, a Uefa Europa League, a Europe Supercup, a Copa Del Rey, a Liga BBVA that hadn't been won
          by other team than Madrid or Barcelona in more than a decade, and reach a Champions League final.
          I'd go on and on, but that about sums the story of a broken team, that stood from the ashes, and is today
          tied in first place in the League with Barcelona, and is in the Champions League semifinals against
          Bayern Munich.

<h2>How I Met Your Mother</h2>
<p>
  Simply can't get enough of this show. Ted, Barney, Robin, Lilly and Marshall are the
  best cast I've ever seen. Very funny, and with very real moments. And with Star Wars references,
  what's not to love. Against popular believe, I did like the finalle.

<h2>Star Wars</h2>

 Simply amazing what George Lucas did. And no, I'm not a big hater of the precuels. They are a bit worse
 than the other ones, but Attack of the Clones and the Revenge of the Sith are not bad movies.
 Remember, Han shot first.

<h2>Aqui No Hay Quien Viva</h2>
<p>
The most relatable show that a Spanish (Spain) can watch. So many inside jokes and unlimited laughes.
Spain not being a big country, this was that show that everyone (Of all ages over 13) would know
and talk about. A show that marked a generation.

  <h2>Eminem</h2>
  <p>
    Eminem is probably one of the first American rappers I ever listened to. It reminds to when I was like 13,
    it was all the American music I'd listen to. The songs I like the most are when he talks about all his
    issues, with Lilly, and Mockingbird...

  <h2>Kaze</h2>
  <p>
After going through Doble V, A3Bandas, Falsalarma... I ended up here.
Kaze is what i'm listening to lately, and it's just very peaceful to listen to. Which sounds ironic being Spanish Rap.
A shine of light in my music in between all that American pop that I get tired of really quickly.

  <h2>Mac Miller</h2>
  <p>
Mac Miller is a cool white guy that I basicly love because he is my best friend's favorite rapper.
Started listening to him when I was an exchange student in Pennsylvania and haven't stopped since. Don't really
share his political views or his druggy lifestyle, but the music is good.
